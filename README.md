Report on our network graph assignment through Gephi. 
-----------------------------------------------------

>An introduction Last week (week 5) we were all given the task of creating a networking graph through the program Gephi. It had to have a range of different things including nodes, edges, bridging, bonding and a range of other features.  Defining some of these things would be a good way to start this report I feel. 

1.Nodes:  Are defined as a point in a diagram or network which lines or pathways intersect a branch.

2.Edges: It involves analytics and knowledge to occur at the centre of the data we are working with. 

3.Bridging: Network bridging describes the action taken by network equipment to allow two or more communication networks, or two or more network segments, to create an aggregate network. Our task was to make this very clear in our finished pdf. 

Our assignment: Was to create a graph that was based off schneidermans netvizz nirvana.  This means a few points had to be followed. 
	Every vertex had to be visible
	Every vertex’s degree is countable
	Every edge can be followed from source to destination 
	All clusters and outliers had to be identifiable 







The Process: 
============
Stage 1: This involved downloading the software Gephi onto our personal computers and getting familiar with it. Once that was complete we had to login to our Facebook pages and access the software Netvizz which gave us the file we needed to analyse our social networking via Gephi. When first opened up the network resembles a black square or hairball it is not very clear what nodes are linked to other ones and the bridging and bonding is all the same colour. At the start this was very off putting as I knew what the end product was supposed to resemble and it wasn’t even halfway there.  Fortunately there are many tutorials out there which our lecturer helped us locate and this got the ball (or nodes!) rolling.  In the early stages of using Gephi I tried loads of the options the programme has to get myself familiar with it. In the end I did not have to use a good few of these but I feel messing about with them heightened my understanding and knowledge. 



Stage 2:  This is where the network started to resemble what the task had set out. After trying out some of the layout options I decided to go with force atlas two as it gave my graph the best shape for seeing the connections and the nodes. I then decided to go into the data laboratory tab in the program Gephi and make my sample smaller. This allows the person looking at my network to see things a lot clearer and makes for a more aesthetically pleasing graph.  Next I tried out the degree and age rank options for sorting my nodes into clusters. Then I added a colour scheme to again make it easier to read and nicer to look at.  I tried a few options before I settled on my final look. 
 
 

Stage 3:  This was the last stage in creating my Gephi graph. It involved final touch ups and add ons and then getting it prepared to be submitted.  I made the nodes slightly bigger, I zoomed into the graph and adhjusted the font, colour and size of the node labels. I then rechecked my task at hand to make sure I had done everything that was assigned to me. Lastly I went into the preview mode on Gephi and saved my project as a PDF as instructed to. 

>In conclusion, this lab exercise was very useful to broadening my knowledge of social computing as it was something entirely new that I had never used before. Gephi although I did have some very difficult moments with the software turned out to be actually fun to use and is a brilliant way of displaying my social network graph. I also learned a lot of new definitions like nodes, bridging and bonding and also picked up some new terms for example, Eigen vector centrality.  Overall a very worthwhile lab exercise that I ultimately enjoyed participating in and completing.
